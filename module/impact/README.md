## §21 IMPACT per Mk (what changes — three tiers, per version)

> Every Mk uses a strict 3-tier structure: ① what changes immediately (demonstration) / ② derived effects (causal) / ③ what does not change (candid).
> Every mkN except mk1 must link the previous-version document (GitHub blob / compare URL).

#### ① What changes immediately (vs mk4, planned)

| Axis | mk4 | mk5 planned |
|---|---|---|
| Voltage / current | 1500 V / 500 A | **3000 V / 1000 A** |
| Cutoff time | 300 ns | **200 ns** (≈ n×33) |
| Topology | SiC 4-die parallel | **SiC + GaN HEMT complement** (ultra-fast turnoff) |
| Intelligence | simple overcurrent trip | **AI pre-fault prediction** (anomaly-pattern detection) |

#### ② Derived effects (mk5 → Mk-∞)

```
mk5 GaN complement + AI -> domestic HVDC long-distance transmission breaker
                       -> TinyML on-die standardization (Samsung 40 nm NPU)
                       -> Mk-∞ singularity (EDiP embedding + 4Q single die)
```

#### ③ What does not change (candid)

- ✗ mk5 still a discrete SiP (EDiP embedding is Mk-∞)
- ✗ BOM $300 — not mass market (industrial only)
- ✗ TinyML false-positive risk — human oversight required

### §21.mk1 — what changes (v1.0, 2026-04-18)

<details>
<summary>📎 <a href="https://github.com/n6-arch/n6-architecture/releases/tag/sscb-mk1-v1.0">sscb-mk1-v1.0 release</a> · <a href="https://github.com/n6-arch/n6-architecture/blob/sscb-mk1-v1.0/domains/compute/sscb/sscb.md">mk1 blob</a> · RELEASED · 2026-04-18</summary>

📎 **git tag**: `sscb-mk1-v1.0`
📎 **release**: [sscb-mk1-v1.0 release](https://github.com/n6-arch/n6-architecture/releases/tag/sscb-mk1-v1.0)
📎 **First version** — no prior version (prev_link not required).

#### ① What changes immediately (demonstration, vs existing market)

| Axis | Existing | after mk1 |
|---|---|---|
| 48 V DC breaker | Wolfspeed $80–150 (US-dependent) | **domestic $32** (4× cheaper) + 100 % domestic supply chain |
| Cutoff speed | mechanical 10–50 ms, I²t=250 kJ @ 5 kA | **600 ns** (16,000× faster), I²t=15 J |
| YesPower utilization | low MPW | first customer for regular custom runs |
| 4-fab MPW cooperation | each in isolation | first simultaneous kick-off demonstration |

#### ② Derived effects (mk1 → Mk-∞ two-stage rocket)

```
mk1 ships -> YesPower gains conviction -> opens custom mask line (🛸10 promotion)
          -> Samsung 40 nm NPU-MCU channel secured -> TinyML on-die
          -> AT&S EDiP shipbuilding-semiconductor fusion -> 1500 V DC breaker
          = data-center / EV HVDC · domestic-defense DC distribution
```

#### ③ What does not change (candid)

- ✗ residential AC distribution-panel breaker market (unchanged)
- ✗ not a Wolfspeed replacement (large / high-voltage still overseas)
- ✗ not price-competitive ($32 > mechanical contactor $5–10)
- ✗ mk1 alone does not change the energy paradigm

**Key point**: mk1 is not a technical breakthrough; it is an **ecosystem-connection demonstration**. Its value is that fabs, investors, and the government see "this works" with their own eyes — and at that moment the path toward Mk-∞ opens.

</details>

## §22 Reduction to two practical questions

The full mk1–mk5 roadmap reduces to the following two questions.

### Question 1: will YesPower open a custom line?

→ **mk1 1 k-unit order is the answer.** By 2026 Q4, ship 100 EA prototypes and request a regular custom run.
   Once YesPower recognizes this customer as "regular", they open the line. Capacity secured from mk2 onward.

### Question 2: when the government / Hyundai / Hanwha ask "do you have a domestic DC breaker?", can you answer "yes"?

→ **mk1 certification (UL 489B + KC) is the answer.** Certifications obtained by the end of 2026 Q4.
   The evidence of "yes" is at least 1 k mk1 units procured, the certificates, and a field-test report.

The **12-month playbook** that answers both questions is the §8–§20 engineering package. mk1 alone does not
change the paradigm, but once both questions are answered the path to Mk-∞ opens.
