# Origin & lineage

This repository was extracted from the **canon** monorepo on
**2026-05-06**. This document records the exact upstream commits and paths
each file was pulled from, so that any change in this repo can be traced
back to (or propagated upstream to) the source-of-truth.

> **2026-05-06 (post-extraction)**: repository renamed `sscb` → `hexa-sscb`
> on GitHub and locally. Upstream path `canon/domains/compute/sscb/`
> and the local `core/sscb/` directory keep their original names — they are
> the n=6 lattice identity reference and must remain 1:1 with the upstream
> SSOT for sync purposes. Only the repo root and public-facing self-references
> were renamed.

## Upstream

- Repo: `canon` (local working copy at `~/core/canon`)
- Branch: `main`
- Extraction date: 2026-05-06
- Extractor: forensic recovery — two of four source markdowns were resurrected
  from a deletion commit's parent (see below).

## File-by-file provenance

| This repo | Upstream path | Commit pulled from | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core/sscb/spec.md` | `papers/sscb-mk1-2026-05-04.md` | working tree (HEAD `b0a45476`) | The inaugural paper (commit `cffa7e21`, Apr 2026). |
| `core/sscb/domain.md` | `domains/compute/sscb/sscb.md` | working tree (HEAD `b0a45476`) | Full domain doc, currently 1320 lines. Last substantive content commit: `068e84da` (§21 IMPACT reverse-chronological restructure). |
| `module/engineering_pack/README.md` | `domains/compute/sscb/sscb_engineering_pack_bak.md` | parent of `a489a368` (deletion commit, Apr 21 2026) | **Recovered from history.** Removed by commit `a489a368` ("English-only public landing header") which deleted both `_bak.md` files. |
| `module/impact/README.md` | `domains/compute/sscb/sscb.md` §21 IMPACT + §22 | working tree (HEAD `b0a45476`) | Extracted as a free-standing module from `domain.md` lines 1121–end. |
| `.own` (replaces deleted `ai-native/CLAUDE.md`) | `domains/compute/sscb/CLAUDE.md` | parent of `ea1bfc97` (purge commit) | `ai-native/CLAUDE.md` was first **recovered from history** (purged by commit `ea1bfc97` "AG10: purge CLAUDE.md + .claude/settings.json — hexa-only harness"), then **deleted again on 2026-05-06** per user directive ("claude.md 금지 → .own 활용"). Agent-scope content reorganized into project-root `.own` (hive raw.mk2 own_v1 schema). |
| `doc/archive/sscb_mk1_predecessor_korean.md` | `domains/compute/sscb/sscb_bak.md` | parent of `a489a368` | **Recovered from history.** Korean-language predecessor of the current `domain.md`. Preserved verbatim. |

- **Binary PDFs** (`sscb_mk1.pdf`, `sscb_mk1_engineering_pack.pdf`,
  `sscb_mk1_impact.pdf`) referenced as 986 KB / 1.2 MB / 404 KB shared via
  KakaoTalk with expiration ~2026-05-01. **No git history** in canon,
  contact, papers, nexus, secret, save, or raw-archive-temp-clone contains

## Atlas anchor provenance (2026-05-13)

The 4 Python verifiers under `verify/` consume atlas anchor shards (`.n6`)
that originally lived under `~/core/canon/atlas/`. During the canon → meta-doc
consolidation (Wave K, 2026-05-12), `~/core/canon/atlas/` was decommissioned
and the SSCB-relevant shards were absorbed into
`~/core/nexus/n6/_absorbed/20260508-190356/`.

To keep this repo's verifier surface **self-contained** (no host-machine
dependency on `~/core/canon` or `~/core/nexus`), the 3 atlas shards needed
by `verify/atlas_anchors.py` were mirrored into `verify/atlas/`:

| File | Originally absorbed from |
|---|---|
| `verify/atlas/atlas.append.engineering-content-mk-next-2026-05-06.n6` | canon/atlas → nexus/n6/_absorbed/20260508-190356/ |
| `verify/atlas/atlas.append.hsscb-mk1-vendor-anchors-2026-05-06.n6` | canon/atlas → nexus/n6/_absorbed/20260508-190356/ |
| `verify/atlas/atlas.append.hsscb-mk1-spec-derived-2026-05-07.n6` | canon/atlas → nexus/n6/_absorbed/20260508-190356/ |

`verify/atlas_anchors.py` resolution order: `HSSCB_ATLAS_DIR` env → repo-local
`verify/atlas/` → legacy `~/core/canon/atlas/` (no-op now). See
[`verify/atlas/README.md`](../../verify/atlas/README.md) for details.

These vendored shards are **mirrors**, not authoritative. Each anchor remains
vendor-attributed via its `anchor=<datasheet>/<section>/<vintage>` field per

## Re-derivation policy

If you change a file in `core/sscb/` here and want to push it upstream:

1. Reproduce the change in `canon/domains/compute/sscb/sscb.md`.
2. If the change is in `module/impact/`, propagate to `sscb.md` §21–§22.
3. `module/engineering_pack/` has no live upstream path (it was deleted in
   `a489a368`); upstream recovery requires re-introducing the file to
   `canon` first.

If you change a file in `doc/archive/`, **stop** — those are immutable
snapshots and must not be edited.
