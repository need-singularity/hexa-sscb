# Origin & lineage

This repository was extracted from the **n6-architecture** monorepo on
**2026-05-06**. This document records the exact upstream commits and paths
each file was pulled from, so that any change in this repo can be traced
back to (or propagated upstream to) the source-of-truth.

## Upstream

- Repo: `n6-architecture` (local working copy at `~/core/n6-architecture`)
- Branch: `main`
- Extraction date: 2026-05-06
- Extractor: forensic recovery — two of four source markdowns were resurrected
  from a deletion commit's parent (see below).

## File-by-file provenance

| This repo | Upstream path | Commit pulled from | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core/sscb/spec.md` | `papers/sscb-mk1-2026-05-04.md` | working tree (HEAD `b0a45476`) | The inaugural paper (commit `cffa7e21`, Apr 2026). |
| `core/sscb/domain.md` | `domains/compute/sscb/sscb.md` | working tree (HEAD `b0a45476`) | Full domain doc, currently 1320 lines. Last substantive content commit: `068e84da` (§21 IMPACT reverse-chronological restructure). |
| `module/engineering_pack/README.md` | `domains/compute/sscb/sscb_engineering_pack_bak.md` | parent of `a489a368` (deletion commit, Apr 21 2026) | **Recovered from history.** Removed by commit `a489a368` ("English-only public landing header") which deleted both `_bak.md` files. |
| `module/impact/README.md` | `domains/compute/sscb/sscb.md` §21 IMPACT + §22 | working tree (HEAD `b0a45476`) | Extracted as a free-standing module from `domain.md` lines 1121–end. |
| `ai-native/CLAUDE.md` | `domains/compute/sscb/CLAUDE.md` | parent of `ea1bfc97` (purge commit) | **Recovered from history.** Purged by commit `ea1bfc97` ("AG10: purge CLAUDE.md + .claude/settings.json — hexa-only harness"). Adapted for repo-local context. |
| `doc/archive/sscb_mk1_predecessor_korean.md` | `domains/compute/sscb/sscb_bak.md` | parent of `a489a368` | **Recovered from history.** Korean-language predecessor of the current `domain.md`. Preserved verbatim. |
| `doc/archive/sscb_mk1_paper_2026-05-04.md.bak` | `raw_archive/2026-05-04T/papers/sscb-mk1-2026-05-04.md.bak` | working tree | Paper backup snapshot. Preserved verbatim. |

## What was searched for and not found

- **Binary PDFs** (`sscb_mk1.pdf`, `sscb_mk1_engineering_pack.pdf`,
  `sscb_mk1_impact.pdf`) referenced as 986 KB / 1.2 MB / 404 KB shared via
  KakaoTalk with expiration ~2026-05-01. **No git history** in n6-architecture,
  contact, papers, nexus, secret, save, or raw-archive-temp-clone contains
  any `sscb*.pdf` blob. **No on-disk copies** found anywhere under `~/core` or
  `~/Downloads` / `~/Desktop`. The Markdown sources in this repo are the
  pre-PDF originals; PDFs can be regenerated via pandoc if needed.

## Re-derivation policy

If you change a file in `core/sscb/` here and want to push it upstream:

1. Reproduce the change in `n6-architecture/domains/compute/sscb/sscb.md`.
2. If the change is in `module/impact/`, propagate to `sscb.md` §21–§22.
3. `module/engineering_pack/` has no live upstream path (it was deleted in
   `a489a368`); upstream recovery requires re-introducing the file to
   `n6-architecture` first.

If you change a file in `doc/archive/`, **stop** — those are immutable
snapshots and must not be edited.
